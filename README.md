    This Repo serves as my submission Repo for Lab 2 : Insta Parse

## Lab Description
    Frameworks Used: ParseSwift, PhotosUI
    
    This app replicates a Instagram like UI.
    
    We use Back4App Parse Backend Server to utilize user authentication
    and store user data like scores and also posts that users makes as photos.
    
    It also has saved log-in session so that
    the user does not have to login everytime s/he opens the app if s/he was previously logged in.
